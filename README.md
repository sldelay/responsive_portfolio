## Week 2 UNH Bootcamp Homework

### Instructions 
First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

### My Approach 
I chose to use Materialize CSS instead of Bootsrap.

I used the same content from my first portfolio page and used Materialze grid to structure the layout of the page.

I used Chrome Dev Tools to test out the sites responsive layout and adjust breakpoints.

I did need to use a few media queries to make minor adjustemts at specific screen sizes.
